      <p>
        I'm a PhD candidate in Polymer Chemistry at UConn, working in the Adamson Research Group. I spend most of my time figuring out how to make graphene and boron nitride do useful things&mdash;specifically, building composites that are lightweight, conductive, and don't catch fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also teach. Before starting my PhD, I taught chemistry at several colleges in Connecticut, mostly to nursing students who needed to understand why medications work the way they do. I like teaching because it forces me to actually understand what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the side, I'm building AeroGraphiX&mdash;an air filter startup that came out of my research. We won the Get Seeded pitch competition in November 2025, and I'm currently an NSF Entrepreneurship Fellow at UConn.

    <p class="mb-xl">I work on making new materials&mdash;mostly composites that conduct electricity, resist heat, or do both at once.</p>

        <h3>Graphene &amp; h-BN Composites</h3>
        <p>
          Graphene is great at conducting electricity but has a zero bandgap, which limits what you can do with it. By combining it with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), we can tune the electronic properties while also getting better thermal management. I use a technique called SITM (Surface Interface Trapping Method) to make these composites. They're promising for electronics that need to dissipate heat without melting.

        <h3>Functional Nanostructured Materials</h3>
        <p>
          I'm also working with graphene oxide and butyl acrylate, using ATRP and Click chemistry to build nanostructured materials with specific properties. The goal is to design materials at the molecular level and then actually make them in the lab.

      <h3>How I Teach</h3>
      <p>
        Chemistry makes more sense when you're holding a beaker than when you're staring at a textbook. I try to get students into the lab as much as possible, even when I'm teaching nursing students who just need to pass one chemistry course. I've taught everyone from first-graders in India to community college students in Hartford, and the common thread is that people learn better when they're doing something with their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also spend a lot of time in office hours. Some students need extra help, and that's fine&mdash;it's part of the job.
